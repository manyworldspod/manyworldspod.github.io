*Where Many Worlds Fit* is a podcast covering international movements for
radical autonomy. Many of these movements are led by indigenous peoples but
consist of a pluralistic society, and grow out of the surprisingly natural
union of long-held cultural traditions with more modern libertarian thought.
Often these movements emerge amidst devastating civil wars or within the
territories of failed nation-states, and while defending themselves from
fascists. We are particularly interested in the Kurdish-led Autonomous
Administration of North and East Syria (AANES, also known as Rojava) and the
Maya-led autonomous region of southeast Mexico in the state of Chiapas (the
Zapatistas of the Lacondan Jungle), but we will broaden our lens as we learn
more, actively and together.

To tell these stories, we incorporate four broad approaches.

### I. gonzo journalism

A threat to freedom anywhere is a threat to freedom everywhere. Indigenous
struggles for autonomy and self-determination are happening right now in many
parts of the world, and they could really use our help. This podcast aims to
provide some of that help in the form of documentation, education, and
advocacy. It grows out of the idea that international solidarity is more
effective when it carries both context and intent.

### II. sociology

Many of the researchers in the so-called West already documenting these
movements do so within the professional academic field of sociology. Yet this
podcast (along with many of the aforementioned researchers) is/are very
explicit about the many problems with professional academia. So in the spirit
of being good accomplices, we aim to democratize the sociological record for
our subjects. We especially want to bring to the intellectual commons things
that serve the public interest, topics with strong relevance at home such as
alternative justice and education systems and jiniology.

### III. oral history

Doing this confers many advantages, among the most important of which is to
counter state messaging and propaganda. The Turkish and Syrian states have long
denied the Kurdish right to exist; the Mexican state denies basic support to
Maya and other indigenous peoples across the country; the American and Canadian
states are infamous for genocide and slavery. "We" the constructed public are
denied an awful lot of this context as part of their violent cultural erasure.
Oral histories are not only compatible with many indigenous traditions – they
are also a tactic, a kind of Rosetta stone for the rest of us who would stand
in solidarity with our indigenous compas.

### IV. solarpunk futures

If you're trying to sprout a better world, you need soil with need an active
imagination. What will it look like to realize land back in your neighborhood?
How will our notions of justice be influenced by efforts to mitigate and adapt
to the effects of climate change? We occasionally combine speculative fiction
with the very real history of radical autonomous movements to help foresee how
one could play out in our own backyard, and how we get there.

## episode formats

---

Our podcast aims to be a collaborative project, mixing together a few different
perspectives and episode formats. We release on a sporadic schedule,
oscillating between a couple times a week and a couple times a season. This is
an intentional strategy as it allows us more editorial freedom to cultivate
material, and our community of listeners more time and energy to converse
with it.

Our more common episode formats are as follows:

### scripted articles

These are long-form essays and journalistic articles, offering information,
context, and analysis, generally read by the author(s) and 30-90 minutes in
length. Each episode’s text is published online.

### interviews

Original research is conducted in the form of interviews and released as
available. Current interview subjects include internationalist organizers,
sociologists, a Kurdish journalist, and a houseless organizer.

### short stories

Like the scripted articles, short stories are 30-90 minutes in length, read by
the author, and constitute speculative fiction with a solarpunk bent. These
stories are meant to help us better imagine and articulate the kind of world we
want to create.

### field reporting

A rather ambitious goal is to travel to places like Chiapas and northeast Syria
to conduct field reporting. This is challenging to pull off but it is something
to work towards. There are also places closer to home where Indigenous land
stewardship continues, like the Menominee forest in north Wisconsin, and land
defenders are active, like the
[Gidimt'en Checkpoint](https://www.yintahaccess.com/) where the Wet'suwet'en
Nation is resisting encroachment by oil pipelines.
